# MJ frontend todo

## Further improvements
- `Improve MJs config validation, can still do a status of 900
- Would be nice if saved yaml had newlines between endpoints
- The UI currently implies you can have both a request body and a form, but that doesn't really make sense. Make the UI force user to fill one or the other.
- Proptypes for key areas, such as the endpoint data passed into the renderer

## Tech debt
- Find `todo` marked in code
- Not much tests around new endpoints created
- No tests at all around the react stuff!
- CSS is a mess, needs to be tidied. Is there a tool to remove unused things because there will be loads
